[C] ArithmeticError
[D] RuntimeError

CORRECT: B

==QUESTION 9==
Which exception is raised when a variable is referenced before it has been assigned a value?
[A] ReferenceError
[B] NameError
[C] ValueError
[D] UnboundLocalError

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: NameError is raised when a local or global name is not found. UnboundLocalError is a subclass of NameError specifically for local variables.

==QUESTION 10==
What exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type?
[A] TypeError
[B] ValueError
[C] AttributeError

Which of the following is an abstract exception?
[A] Exception
[B] ArithmeticError
[C] LookupError
[D] All of the above

CORRECT: D
EXPLANATION: Exception, ArithmeticError, and LookupError are all abstract exceptions. They serve as base classes for more specific exceptions.

==QUESTION 12==
What exception is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary?
[A] IndexError
[B] KeyError
[C] LookupError
[D] ValueError

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: KeyError is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.

==QUESTION 13==
Which exception is raised when an error occurs that doesn't fall into any specific category?
[A] GenericError
[B] StandardError
[C] Exception
[D] BaseException

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: Exception is a catch-all exception for most built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions.

==QUESTION 14==
What is the parent class of ArithmeticError?
[A] LookupError
[B] ValueError
[C] Exception
[D] StandardError

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: ArithmeticError is a direct subclass of Exception.

==QUESTION 15==
Which exception is raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value?
[A] TypeError
[B] ValueError
[C] ArgumentError
[D] InputError

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: ValueError is raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but with an inappropriate value.

==QUESTION 16==
What is the relationship between Exception and BaseException?
[A] Exception is a subclass of BaseException
[B] BaseException is a subclass of Exception
[C] They are sibling classes
[D] They are not related

CORRECT: A
EXPLANATION: Exception is a direct subclass of BaseException.

Which of the following is NOT a direct subclass of Exception?
[A] ArithmeticError
[B] LookupError
[C] KeyboardInterrupt
[D] ValueError

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: KeyboardInterrupt is a direct subclass of BaseException, not Exception.

[A] IOError
[B] FileError
[C] ValueError
[D] OSError

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: ValueError is raised when trying to perform operations on a closed file. In Python 3, IOError and OSError have been merged into OSError.
