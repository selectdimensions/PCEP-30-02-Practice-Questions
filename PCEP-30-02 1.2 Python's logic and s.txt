==QUESTION 1==
Which of the following is not a Python keyword?
[A] while
[B] for
[C] loop
[D] if

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: "loop" is not a Python keyword. The other options (while, for, if) are all valid Python keywords used for control flow.

==QUESTION 2==
What is the purpose of indentation in Python?
[A] To make the code look neat
[B] To define code blocks
[C] To increase code execution speed
[D] To declare variables

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: In Python, indentation is used to define code blocks. It's a crucial part of the language's syntax and determines the structure and scope of code.

==QUESTION 3==
How do you write a single-line comment in Python?
[A] // Comment
[B] /* Comment */
[C] # Comment
[D] <!-- Comment -->

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: In Python, single-line comments are written using the hash symbol (#). Everything after # on that line is treated as a comment.

==QUESTION 4==
Which of the following is a valid Python instruction?
[A] print "Hello, World!"
[B] print("Hello, World!")
[C] echo "Hello, World!"
[D] console.log("Hello, World!")

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: In Python 3, print is a function and requires parentheses. Therefore, print("Hello, World!") is the correct syntax.

==QUESTION 5==
What happens if you mix tabs and spaces for indentation in Python?
[A] Nothing, it works fine
[B] It raises an IndentationError
[C] The code runs slower
[D] It automatically converts all to spaces

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: Mixing tabs and spaces for indentation in Python can lead to an IndentationError. It's recommended to use either all tabs or all spaces (preferably spaces) for consistency.

==QUESTION 6==
Which keyword is used to define a function in Python?
[A] function
[B] def
[C] define
[D] func

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: In Python, the 'def' keyword is used to define a function. For example: def function_name():

==QUESTION 7==
What is the correct way to start an if statement in Python?
[A] if (condition):
[B] if condition
[C] if: condition
[D] if condition:

CORRECT: D
EXPLANATION: The correct syntax for an if statement in Python is 'if condition:'. The colon is necessary, and parentheses are optional.

==QUESTION 8==
How do you write a multi-line comment in Python?
[A] // Comment //
[B] /* Comment */
[C] ''' Comment '''
[D] <!-- Comment -->

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: Multi-line comments in Python are written using triple quotes (either ''' or """). This allows for comments that span multiple lines.

==QUESTION 9==
Which of the following is not a valid way to end a Python instruction?
[A] Newline
[B] Semicolon
[C] Colon
[D] Both A and B are valid

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: In Python, instructions typically end with a newline. Semicolons can be used to separate multiple statements on one line, but are not required. Colons are used for starting new blocks, not ending instructions.

==QUESTION 10==
What does the `pass` keyword do in Python?
[A] It skips the rest of the loop
[B] It acts as a placeholder for future code
[C] It raises an exception
[D] It terminates the program

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The 'pass' keyword in Python is a null operation. It's used as a placeholder where syntactically some code is required, but no action is desired.

==QUESTION 11==
Which of the following is true about Python's `else` clause?
[A] It can only be used with if statements
[B] It can be used with for loops
[C] It can be used with while loops
[D] Both B and C are correct

CORRECT: D
EXPLANATION: In Python, the 'else' clause can be used not only with if statements, but also with for and while loops. In loops, it executes when the loop completes normally (without a break).

==QUESTION 12==
What is the purpose of the `continue` keyword in Python?
[A] To exit a loop
[B] To skip the rest of the current iteration
[C] To pause the program execution
[D] To start a new function

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The 'continue' keyword in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.

==QUESTION 13==
How many spaces are recommended for each level of indentation in Python?
[A] 2
[B] 3
[C] 4
[D] 8

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: The Python Style Guide (PEP 8) recommends using 4 spaces per indentation level. This is not a strict rule, but it's widely adopted in the Python community.

==QUESTION 14==
Which keyword is used to define a class in Python?
[A] class
[B] define
[C] struct
[D] object

CORRECT: A
EXPLANATION: In Python, the 'class' keyword is used to define a class. For example: class ClassName:

==QUESTION 15==
What is the output of the following code?
```python
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Non-positive")
print("Done")
```
[A] Positive
[B] Positive
   Done
[C] Non-positive
   Done
[D] Done

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The code will output "Positive" because x (5) is greater than 0. The "Done" print statement is not indented under the else block, so it will always execute regardless of the condition.

==QUESTION 16==
Which of the following is not a valid loop in Python?
[A] for loop
[B] while loop
[C] do-while loop
[D] All of the above are valid

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: Python does not have a built-in do-while loop. It has for loops and while loops, but no do-while construct.

==QUESTION 17==
What is the purpose of the `break` keyword in Python?
[A] To exit a loop prematurely
[B] To skip the current iteration
[C] To define a function
[D] To raise an exception

CORRECT: A
EXPLANATION: The 'break' keyword in Python is used to exit a loop prematurely. When encountered inside a loop, it immediately terminates the loop and transfers control to the next statement after the loop.

==QUESTION 18==
Which of the following is a valid way to import a module in Python?
[A] #include <module>
[B] import module
[C] using module
[D] require module

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: In Python, modules are imported using the 'import' keyword. The correct syntax is 'import module_name'.

==QUESTION 19==
What is the correct way to start a while loop in Python?
[A] while (condition):
[B] while condition:
[C] while: condition
[D] while condition

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: The correct syntax for a while loop in Python is 'while condition:'. The colon is necessary, and parentheses are optional.

==QUESTION 20==
Which keyword is used to handle exceptions in Python?
[A] catch
[B] except
[C] handle
[D] try

CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: In Python, exceptions are handled using try-except blocks. The 'except' keyword is used to catch and handle exceptions.

==QUESTION 21==
What is the purpose of the `finally` clause in exception handling?
[A] To define the main code block
[B] To specify what to do if no exception occurs
[C] To execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred
[D] To raise a custom exception

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: The 'finally' clause in Python's exception handling is used to define a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's often used for cleanup operations.

==QUESTION 22==
How do you define a lambda function in Python?
[A] lambda: expression
[B] def lambda(x): expression
[C] lambda x: expression
[D] function lambda(x) { expression }

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: In Python, lambda functions are defined using the syntax 'lambda arguments: expression'. They are small anonymous functions that can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression.

==QUESTION 23==
What does the `global` keyword do in Python?
[A] Declares a global variable
[B] Imports a global module
[C] Creates a global function
[D] Defines a global constant

CORRECT: A
EXPLANATION: The 'global' keyword in Python is used to declare that a variable inside a function is global (i.e., it belongs to the global scope). It allows you to modify the global variable from within a function.

==QUESTION 24==
Which of the following is true about Python's `elif` keyword?
[A] It's equivalent to "else if" in other languages
[B] It can only be used once in an if-else chain
[C] It must always be followed by an else clause
[D] It can only be used with while loops

CORRECT: A
EXPLANATION: In Python, 'elif' is short for "else if". It's used to check multiple conditions after an initial 'if' statement, and is equivalent to "else if" constructs in other languages.

==QUESTION 25==
What is the purpose of the `with` statement in Python?
[A] To define a new class
[B] To handle exceptions
[C] To ensure proper acquisition and release of resources
[D] To create a new module

CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: The 'with' statement in Python is used to ensure proper acquisition and release of resources. It provides a clean way to manage resources like file handles, ensuring they are properly closed or released after use, even if exceptions occur.
